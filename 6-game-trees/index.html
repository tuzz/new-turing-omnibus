    This is a working example of the Minimax algorithm as described in the Game
    Trees chapter in the New Turing Omnibus. The computer opponent uses the
    Minimax algorithm to determine its best possible move. If this has been
    programmed correctly, you will never win (sorry).
    </p>

    <p>
    When the computer has a choice between multiple "best moves", it prefers to
    take the move that results in a faster win or a prolonged loss for itself.
    This is achieved by

    <a href="https://github.com/tuzz/new-turing-omnibus/blob/gh-pages/6-game-trees/lib/gameTrees/positionEvaluator.js#L12">
    biasing the evaluation
    </a>

    of positions according to how many squares remain.
    </p>

    <p>
    At present, this application does not implement alpha-beta pruning which
    would significantly reduce the number of comparisons required during the
    Minimax algorithm. As a result, the first move the computer makes is
    noticeably slower than subsequent moves.
